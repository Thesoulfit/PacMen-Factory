# PacMen Factory
Packmen Factory is an animation file in which pacmen moves from one wall boundry to another bouncing back and forth.

## How to run?
To run this you have to make sure that all the files required(all 4 images of pacman, index.html and pacmen.js file) on your local machine. After that just open index.html file on your browser.

## Future Improvements
In future i would like to add controls for the user to manipulate the direction of pacman and add some purpose for the movement of pacman.
